# WoW Project

Work in Progress.
The idea behind this project is to explore blizzard's api and see what data I can get out of it and untangle the mess of using an external API.
Meanwhile trying to follow best pratice as I know.

Learning how to use Blazor WebAssembly, new thing for me. Used to work with MVC.
